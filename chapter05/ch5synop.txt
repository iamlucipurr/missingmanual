chapter 5 synopsis - Jake Aubrey

in this chapter i went through the process of learning about events. 
Using events in jquery are loads easier then just using java script 
and i happen to be a major fan. i like how this book goes through a 
lot of the events you can use in jquery and its in depth description 
of all of them.
