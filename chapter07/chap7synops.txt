chapter 7 synopsis - Jake aubrey

in this chapter you learn about general stuff you can do with jquery. 

this includes but is not limited to swapping images, 
doing roll-overs, gallery effects, and controlling links.

i found all of these things to be pretty usefull 
and i would love to be able to implement them in my site.
